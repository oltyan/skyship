     What is SkyShip?
 </strong>
 <br/>
 <p align="justify">
    SkyShip is an API interface that sits on top of some of the most powerful open source tools available to manage cloud infrastructure. It also has a stable of automation modules and scripts that can provision and manage your sprawling IT infrastructure. All of this can be handled through our API interface or Web Console, depending on your preference. See our [“Product Info”] page for more information on the technologies we leverage.

<strong>
    Why use SkyShip?
</strong>
<p align="justify">
    Aren’t those all open source technologies that I can setup myself? Yes, they are, and they are among the best of the available that we have found. You can spend years working on understanding how to optimize your installations for any one of those services, but we believe that you would rather be spending that time elsewhere. SkyShip takes the pain of managing and updating your infrastructure away, allowing you to focus on making your product better.

SkyShip also provides access to all our modules and the framework for modifying and updating it. If you find you want to deep dive into your database configurations because you have specialized needs, you have a testing framework already in place to build on.
